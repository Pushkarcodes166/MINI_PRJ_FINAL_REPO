# TODO: Enhance Career Guidance App with Real-World Integration Features

## New Features Implementation
- [x] Create mock data files: /data/jobs.js and /data/opportunities.js with sample job and internship listings
- [x] Create JobBoardPage.jsx: New page to display job listings filtered by career, using mock data
- [x] Create ResumeBuilderPage.jsx: Form-based page for user input (personal details, skills from tests), generate PDF resume using jsPDF
- [x] Create OpportunitiesPage.jsx: Page for internship/training listings, similar to job board
- [x] Update routing in App.jsx to include new routes for JobBoard, ResumeBuilder, and Opportunities pages
- [x] Update navigation: Add links in StudentDashboard.jsx to these new features

## Followup Steps
- [x] Install jsPDF for resume PDF generation if not already installed
- [x] Update UI theme and structure of Job Board, Opportunities, and Resume Builder to match overall theme
- [ ] Test new pages for functionality and responsiveness
- [ ] Verify integration with user flow and existing features (test results, recommendations)
- [ ] Run the dev server to test the page visually
- [ ] Check responsiveness on different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify button functionalities and animations
